*    as well as configuration information for the program.                   *
*                                                                            *

*  ##### Keys recognized for a radio definition record:                      *
*    name   - The name to be assigned to a specific radio.                   *
*             This name can be any combination of ASCII characters,          *
*               EXCEPT ',' and '='                                           *
*             It SHOULD be a unique name for every radio defined.            *
*             If the name is not unique, the program will modify it to make  *
*              it so.                                                        *
*               This is a REQUIRED keyword for a radio definition record     *

*                 'local'     (default)                                      *

*               This is a REQUIRED keyword for a radio definition record     *
*    model  - model name for a radio definition record.                      *
*             Used when different models of a radio type                     *
*             (protocol) behave differently. Not case sensitive.             *
*             Not required IF the program has the ability to detect the      *
*              model number, or there is only one.                           *
*             Required if AUTOBAUD is used, or the radio is one of the       *
*              following models:                                             *
*               icom: r7000, icr30, ic703                                    *
*    radioaddr - radio address for a radio definition record.                *
*                 Required for ALL ICOM radios. Ignored for all others       *
*                 value is hex 00-FF                                         *
*    baudrate - Suggested baud rate for a radio definition record.           *
*                 Only needed if the baud rate cannot be determined by the   *
*                 program ('autobaud').                                      *
*    port     - Suggested serial port for connection.                        *
*                 Only needed if the port cannot be determined by the        *
*                 program ('autobaud').                                      *
*                 Port is usually /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttyACMx (where 'x'    *
*                   is a number from 0-9)                                    *

*                Uniden SD100/SD200 & ICOM R30. Default is ~/radioctl        *
*                If the specified directory does NOT exist, the program      *
*                will attempt to create it.                                  *
*                                                                            *
* The serial port and baud rate CAN be changed from the Main panel of the    *
*  GUI, or specified by options on the command line program.                 *
*                                                                            *

* DIRECTORY - Defines directory usage for various operations                 *
*             Any directory key that is NOT defined will default to          *
*              ~/radioctl                                                    *

* ### Keywords for LOCATION  records                                         * 
*  name   - The name of this location. If the name is 'home' (case is        *
*             not important), this location will be used whenever a default  *

*  lat    - Latitude for this location. Can be in format:                    *

*   discarded. If a 'home' location record is NOT specified in this file,    *
